# Data of 5-node and 2000-node Power Systems 🌇

## Goals 🚀

The aim of this repository is to provide the details of the power systems data set used in papers [1]. This article have been developed by some members of the [OASYS group](https://sites.google.com/view/groupoasys/home) thanks to the funding of the project [Flexanalytics](https://groupoasysflexanalytics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We suggest you to visit the related links to know more our research 😉

## Contents 🌌

This repository includes the data about small-size system designed for illustrative purposes; and a power system in Texas which is extracted from a [repository of power grids](https://github.com/power-grid-lib/pglib-opf).
This data set contains net demands per node, and besides, information about generating units and transmission lines. 

- Five-node System:

  * [Generating Units](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v3CDYvdzuszUF5EAaVWTHV_mzjmjyDrK/view?usp=sharing)
  * [Lines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jBd_JpA2jdkXJLnO1ZvHh4UZAD0mpSWQ/view?usp=sharing)
  * [Net Demands](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wCOYypnlDXI3w4Crn0Jz0hQl9rNeYKTd/view?usp=sharing)

- For the 2000-node system, net demand profiles for each node are synthetically derived from the nominal demand presented in the [repository](https://github.com/power-grid-lib/pglib-opf). It should be noted that the nominal parameters regarding the line
capacity and generating units have been conveniently modified. More details about these changes can be found in the paper [1]. Each data file is linked below:
